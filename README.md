# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

bookbot counts characters in books

books are .gitignored but can be added from Project Gutenberg. To try an example, run:

```bash
wget -O books/mobydick.txt https://storage.googleapis.com/qvault-webapp-dynamic-assets/course_assets/mobydick.txt
wget -O books/prideandprejudice.txt https://storage.googleapis.com/qvault-webapp-dynamic-assets/course_assets/prideandprejudice.txt
```
